# Flappy Bird JS üê¶
Flappy Bird clone written in JavaScript using the p5.js library

## How to play
To play, you can either click or press any key to move the bird and avoid the pipes. High scores aren't persistent, and will be reset to 0 upon reloading the page.

## Installation
You can play online [here](https://editor.p5js.org/owen.laney/full/OWCQoqEBI). If you want to contribute or play without an internet connection create a local p5.js [server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).
