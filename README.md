# Flappy Bird
This is a Flappy Bird clone written with JavaScript and p5.js library. I was inspired by Kurzgesagt's animation style when I made the design, so this should look pretty familiar if you've ever watched them.\

## How to
This works the same was as regular flappy bird - click anywhere or press any key to jump and avoid the pipes!
