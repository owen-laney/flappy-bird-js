# Flappy Bird
This is a Flappy Bird clone written with JavaScript and p5.js library. I was inspired by Kurzgesagt's animation style when I made the design, so this should look pretty familiar if you've ever watched them.\

## How to
To play, you can either click or press any key to move the bird and avoid the pipes. High scores aren't persistent, and will be reset to 0 upon reloading the page.

## Install & Play
You can play online [here](https://editor.p5js.org/owen.laney/full/OWCQoqEBI). If you want to contribute or play without an internet connection create a local p5.js [server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server).
